I'm a licensed professional engineer and full-stack software developer. I use my engineering expertise to create software that advances sustainable practices in the built environment and build the tools I wish I had when working solely as a design professional.

I have experience / interest in the following:

* high performance Python and software optimization 
* domain-driven design
* data visualization and geospatial analysis
* research in sustainable design and embodied carbon accounting
* open source engineering software (FEA, interoperability, etc.)
* building digital tools to complement engineering expertise
* equity in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)


I currently work on a contract basis. Please feel free to reach out with any project ideas or opportunities for collaboration.
